# Original Readme

Welcome to the Bonsai Magento Challenge!

Bonsai is a mobile application and technology company. We’re interested in how content inspires action. By personalizing delivery of the world’s leading content, we enable the discovery of products or experiences that make your life better, cooler and more interesting. As a venture-backed startup that’s raised $6M to date (on-track to raise a $20M Series A), we work with leading media companies and retailers to prove the content-commerce thesis.

We are looking for intermediate/senior php developers that can hit the ground running building full-features for an open-source e-commerce project. This environment simulates the work as closely as possible, so that's great news if you can navigate your way around this stack.

Good luck!
